				 Tuntitko 0.0.1
			       -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* Compilation

** XFree86 v 3.3.x

  Untar source tarball and edit makefile to meed your needs. For now Makefile
expects that XFree86 source code is untared in /usr/src/xc directory (this
should change in future and tuntitko will cary necessary include files so users
can compile tuntitko without need of untared source code for whole X server...)

* Configuration (/etc/XF86Config)

** Section "Module"

  For XFree86 3.3 add folowing line:

	Load "tuntitko-33.so"

** Section "Xinput"

 Up to four SubSections "LInputX" (x = 0..3), in each subsection these
lines can be used:

*** DeviceName STRING

  Where string is name of device as it will be known to X
applications.

*** Device PATH

  Where PATH is path to Linux Input Driver's event device file which
you want to use as X input device - for example "/dev/input/event0"

*** NumberOfValuators NUMBER

  NUMBER of valuators to be supported by your X device. Up to 6
valuators are supported by X input devices (FIXME: afaik, have to find
some reference in other docs :)

*** Valuator N

  This keyword starts small sub-subsection to specify attributes of
N-th valuator. This subsection should be ended using EndValuator
keyword.


**** Map "VALUATORNAME"

  Maps N-th valuator to Linux Input Device VALUATORNAME. This name of
valuator is the same as reported from (for example) evtest utility
from linux input utilities package.

**** Reverse NUMBER

  If non zero, valuator will be reported reverted (upside down)

*** Button NUMBER BUTTON_NAME

  Maps BUTTON_NAME (which is any valid button name as reported from evtest
utility) to button NUMBER. NUMBER is positive integer (in X buttons start from 1)
If you supply -1 as button NUMBER, button reporting will be disabled...

** Default vaues for LInputX 

  (where X is number between 0 and 3)

  DeviceName	"LInputX"
  Device	"/dev/input/eventX"
  NumberOfValuators 2
  Valuator 0
    Map "X"
  EndValuator 
  Valuator 1
    Map "Y"
  EndValuator   

** Example for "KYE SYSTEM Corp Tablet"

   Section "Xinput"
       SubSection "LInput1"
   	   DeviceName      "Tablet"
   	   Device          "/dev/input/event0"
   	   NumberOfValuators 3
   	   Valuator 0
   	     Map	"X"
   	   EndValuator
   	   Valuator 1
   	     Map   "Y"
   	     Reverse 1
   	   EndValuator
   	   Valuator 2
   	     Map    "Pressure"
   	   EndValuator	
	   Button  "Touch"   1
	   Button  "Stylus"  2
	   Button  "ToolPen" "disabled"   # ??? pen near tablet reported by
					  # linux input ??? -=> disable ! :)
       EndSubSection
   EndSection

* Usage

** Changing core pointer `xsetpointer NAME'
  
  Where NAME is name of our input device - for example `xsetpointer Tablet' from
our "KYE SYSTEM Corp Tablet" example above.

** Using devices in Gnome/Gtk applications

*** Compiling Gtk+

  Gtk+ 1.2.x should be configured with xfree input support (--with-xinput=xfree). 
Do not know why but second option (gxid) did not worked... (so I should figure
later... :)

  After compile you should try to run gtk+-1.2.x/gtk/testinput and check if your
device appeared in input dialog.

*** Gimp

  If testinput program (from gtk source code tree) worked for you, using Gimp & Linux
input devices should be stright forward. Just bring down Input dialog and
Configure your device according to your needs.

  Happy Gimping!
